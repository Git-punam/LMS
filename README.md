# Library Management System
An application with separate admin and student modules. JWT was used for authorization. Both admins and students can sign up, login, and change their own profile information. Admin has the ability to add, edit, and delete book information, as well as issue and return books. The 'Return date' and 'Late fine' are calculated based on 'Issue date' and 'Actual return date' respectively. Students can view their own assigned books and filter books by genre, subgenre, and publisher.
